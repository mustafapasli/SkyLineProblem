The Skyline Problem

From a distance, the view of a collection of high-rise buildings reveals a profile. With sufficient simplifications, this observation turns into a problem called the skyline problem. The objective is to find the profile created by the roofs of the buildings. The simplifications are: All of the buildings are represented by rectangles and the profile is on 2D plane.
